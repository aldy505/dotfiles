This is here in case anything goes wrong. I'm using WSL2 (Windows Subsystem Linux), so no window manager or something like that.

I'm licensing it under [WTFPL](./LICENSE). If you want to steal a script or two, that's totally fine, even without asking my permission.

Use [issues](https://github.com/aldy505/dotfiles/issues) for any questions.
